# Estuarine discharge forecasting
The model presented here was used to predict the discharges to the estuary at Caloosahatchee wateshed (Florida) due to the managed outflows at Lake Okeechobee. 

The codes and data used in this repository belong to the publication under review in Journal of Environmental Software & Modeling.

Due to size limits, data and model weights must be downloaded and place in their corresponding folders. To download materials, please go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yeg1ZmXE3OZFX3a-_ZdJTFJ5Le_d9SOm?usp=sharing

Once the data has been downloaded, to run the model go to main.py. That will read the data and run the model with the given weights and return the testing results presented in the manuscript.
