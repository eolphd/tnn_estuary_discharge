The codes and data used in this repository belong to the publication under review in Journal of Environmental Software & Modeling.
Due to size limits, data and model weights should be downloaded and place in their corresponding folders. To download materials, please go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yeg1ZmXE3OZFX3a-_ZdJTFJ5Le_d9SOm?usp=sharing
To run the model go to main.py. That will read the data and the model with the download weights and return the testing results presented in the manuscript.
